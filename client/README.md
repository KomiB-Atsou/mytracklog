# MyTrackLog-app

A simple app to track time used for some aspects of our life. It is a sort of done-list of what we want to track. The item used to track things is called a tracklog. A tracklog belongs to a category. Categories can be organized hierarchically depending on which aspects of our life we wan to track and optimize.

Tracklogs are viewed and managed in a calendar view.

For example we can track time used learning something new so that we can optimize the way we progress. We can describe what we have done in last tracklogs to help us be effective for further steps in attaining an objective. We can also analyze tracklogs to optimize the way we invest our time which is nothing but our best asset after our health.
